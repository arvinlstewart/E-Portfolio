  <!-- About Me Section -->

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>With a background rooted in digital media and a passion for precision, Iâ€™ve built my career at the intersection of programmatic strategy, workflow design, and performance optimization. I bring over a decade of hands-on experience navigating complex advertising ecosystems, from campaign trafficking to strategic media planning and platform automation. My work is driven by a philosophy of clarity and scalability: systems should be as intuitive as they are efficient.</p>
    <p>Whether itâ€™s creating Excel-based automation tools, mentoring teams, or collaborating with product developers to improve DSP functionality, I believe in designing workflows that empower peopleâ€”not replace them. I see ad operations not as a backend function, but as the engine room of great marketingâ€”where data meets decisions, and where optimization can unlock real value.</p>
    <p>In addition to my work in ad operations, Iâ€™ve spent over five years teaching Excel to working professionals across a wide range of industries. This experience has shaped my belief that powerful tools like Excel canâ€”and shouldâ€”be accessible, adaptable, and empowering for teams at every level. Teaching has deepened my commitment to demystifying data and making automation practical, not intimidating.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, I strive to turn fragmented, manual processes into streamlined, insight-driven systems that help teams move faster, work smarter, and focus on what truly matters: performance and growth.</p>
