      <p>Before the first bid is placed, the real campaign begins.</p>

      <p>There’s this adrenaline most campaign managers know too well — the pressure to launch quickly. Clients want performance yesterday. Timelines shrink. Budgets appear out of thin air. But no matter how urgent the campaign, I carve out one to two hours <em>before</em> anything gets built. No line items. No tags. Just strategy. Thought. Foresight.</p>

      <p>Early in my career, I thought speed was value. I would open the DSP, plug in what I was given, and hit launch. But then came the questions:<br>
      - Why isn’t this performing?<br>
      - Why are we pacing too quickly in one region and not another?<br>
      - Why is the CTR fine but conversions tanking?</p>

      <p>Those questions didn’t have answers — not because the data wasn’t available, but because I hadn’t taken time to set <strong>expectations</strong> and define <strong>what success actually looked like</strong>.</p>

      <p><strong>Strategic setup reduces technical debt.</strong><br>
      If a campaign is built in haste, it needs fixing later — restructuring budgets, rebuilding creatives, toggling optimization goals. Each of those mid-flight changes creates noise in the data. But when I block off time to plan things like targeting logic, KPI alignment, pacing strategy, naming conventions, and budget splits — I build with purpose, not panic.</p>

      <p><strong>Naming conventions are not trivial.</strong><br>
      Clean naming = clean data. It’s the first thing I tackle. And I don’t do it manually anymore — I use a dynamic generator I built in Excel to structure names by platform, audience, creative, and more. It ensures consistency, saves time, and supports faster QA.</p>

      <p><strong>Strategy also lets me challenge unclear requests.</strong><br>
      When I’ve taken time to assess the big picture, I can say things like:
      <ul>
        <li>“This KPI won’t be trackable without a better conversion tag.”</li>
        <li>“Budget might be spread too thin across all these platforms.”</li>
        <li>“These creatives are sized wrong for in-feed native.”</li>
      </ul>
      That builds trust with clients. It’s not pushback — it’s thought partnership.</p>

      <p><strong>The launch becomes a confirmation — not a gamble.</strong><br>
      Once I launch, I know I’ve already sanity-checked every element. My dashboards light up with confidence. If anything underperforms, I can isolate it fast — and not waste 48 hours diagnosing what should’ve been caught before go-live.</p>

      <p><strong>In short: strategy isn’t extra. It’s essential.</strong><br>
      A few hours of focus before setup saves you from dozens of hours in cleanup, excuses, and apologies later. I’ve learned that the hard way — and now, I make it my standard.</p>
